This is another project from JetBrains Academy that emulates the online chat bots. Here I've learned a lot about binary trees, it's structure and how to traverse it, Json serialization and deserialization and more. This is the link to the task: https://hyperskill.org/projects/132?track=17

It uses binary tree to keep the data it learns from each session and saves the knowledge tree in json format inside a local file for future use. 

It is also one of the first projects that I did and with that I have to warn you in advance that it's quite a spaghetti code. It seems now that I look at it that it'd be easier to remake it from scratch than to try and refactor all of it - but that might still be my inexperience...
